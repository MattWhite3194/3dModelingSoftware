3D hard surface modeling software created in c++  
Uses OpenGL for a graphics API  
GLFW for window control  
ImGUI for User Interface.

The tool is intended for hard surface modeling of manifold geometry.  
The goal is to create a modeling software with a simple set of tools that are easy to understand, find, and use.

The HalfEdge data structure is used to store 3d geometry.
